# Demultiplexing and Index Swapping - Assignment the Second

An important part of writing code is reviewing code - both your own and other's. In this portion of the assignment, you will be assigned 3 students' algorithms to review. Be sure to evaluate the following points:

- Does the proposed algorithm make sense to you? Can you follow the logic?
- Does the algorithm do everything it's supposed to do? (see list of requirements in [Assignment the First](../Assignment-the-first/Demult_Assignment-the-first.pdf))
- Are proposed functions reasonable? Are they "standalone" pieces of code?

Visit Canvas to see your assigned reviewees. You can find your fellow students' repositories at

```https://github.com/<user>/demultiplex```

**If you created your repo somewhere else, please move it to the above location!!!**

Be sure to leave your feedback on their repositories by creating issues or by commenting. These comments should also be submitted to the Canvas assignment (to make grading easier on us.
