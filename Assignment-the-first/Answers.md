| File name | label |
|---|---|
| 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | read1 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | index1 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | index2 |
| 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | read2 |

2. Per-base NT distribution
    1. Use markdown to insert your 4 histograms here.
    2. ```Your answer here```

## Part 2
1. Define the problem
```
We want to bucket our multiplexed data. We also know that we have some index hopping present in the data, meaning we have to filter out the bad indexes. 
```
2. Describe output
3. Upload your [4 input FASTQ files](../TEST-input_FASTQ) and your [>=6 expected output FASTQ files](../TEST-output_FASTQ).
4. Pseudocode
5. High level functions. For each function, be sure to include:
    1. Description/doc string
    2. Function headers (name and parameters)
    3. Test examples for individual functions
    4. Return statement
